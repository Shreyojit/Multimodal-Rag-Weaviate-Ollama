The multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system integrates several advanced AI technologies to provide highly accurate and contextually relevant responses. It utilizes **LLaMA 3.3 70B**, a powerful instruction-tuned model, to generate human-like responses to user queries. The system employs **Weaviate**, a vector database, for efficient management and retrieval of multimodal content. **Ollama** embeddings are used to process various content types, including text, images, audio, and tables, ensuring the system can handle diverse data formats. Additionally, **Nomic-Embed-Text** embeddings transform textual data into dense vector representations, enabling precise searches. The inclusion of **LLaVA-70B** enhances the model's ability to synthesize multimodal data, providing enriched responses based on context from different sources.
