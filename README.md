# Multimodal-Rag-Weaviate-Ollama
The multimodal RAG system combines **LLaMA 3.3 70B** for response generation and **Weaviate** for efficient vector-based content retrieval. It leverages **Ollama** embeddings for processing text, images, audio, and tables, and **Nomic-Embed-Text** for accurate text search. **LLaVA-70B** enhances multimodal context synthesis for richer responses.
