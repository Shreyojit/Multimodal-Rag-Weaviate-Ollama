Also, some investors are taking a more cautious approach to ESG investing in the wake of the underperformance of ESG and sustainable strategies in 2022 partly owing to their typical underweight in traditional energy companies and overweight in technology and other growth sectors. While the technology sector rebounded in 2023, other popular sectors in sustainable strategies continued to underperform. Renewable energy companies, for example, have been particularly affected by soaring financing costs, materials inflation, and supply chain disruptions, among other issues."
